## ðŸš€ Getting Started


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### ðŸ”§ Installation & Running the Website

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fasterrob/portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**

   npm install

   //or if you use yarn:

   yarn install
   ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

   //or with yarn:

   yarn dev
   ```
5. **Open your browser and visit:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
